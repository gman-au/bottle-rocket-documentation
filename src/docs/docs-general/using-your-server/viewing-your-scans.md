# Viewing Your Scans

Bottle Rocket uses local storage to store copies of scanned images received via the Bottle Rocket app.

## Viewing Scans
* Login to your Bottle Rocket server.
* On the left-hand sidebar, select **My scans**.

<div class="text--center">
![My Scans](/img/sidebarMyScans.png)
</div>

* If your Bottle Rocket app has been able to successfully send scans to this server, they
should appear here. 
* For convention, they are sorted by date, with the most recent captures appearing first.

<div class="text--center">

* To view the details of a specific scan, click on the **Details** link under the related scan.
