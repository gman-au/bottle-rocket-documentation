## What is Rocketbook?

* [How Rocketbook works - from the Rocketbook web site](https://getrocketbook.com/pages/how-rocketbook-works)

Rocketbook refers to the all-in-one product suite of re-usable notebooks, cards, calendars,
and other assorted items that make use of erasable paper and (specific) pens to take notes.

The "Rocketbook app" also refers to the [accompanying mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rb.rocketbook)
that will automatically scan and forward these notes using the QR codes found on the pages to 
assist with the page capture.

For people that prefer to take notes using traditional pen and paper as opposed to a completely digital method,
Rocketbook is a fantastic product. You can quickly jot down thoughts, notes, reminders, plans, and the like on 
a piece of paper for digital preservation at a later point in time.
You can be completely offline and only need ink in your pen.

## What is the future of Rocketbook?

### Current discussions and news
* [Life After Rocketbook](https://rocketbookreplacement.com/)

* [From the Rocketbook FAQ](https://getrocketbook.com/pages/faqs):
> _**Is it true that BIC is discontinuing the Rocketbook brand?**_
>
> _You are correct that BIC is exiting the Rocketbook business. However, Rocketbook products will still be available for purchase while supplies last._
> _BIC will continue to support the app for at least one year after BIC’s exit from the business._
> _We do not know at this time whether the brand will continue beyond BIC._

When discussing this topic, it is important to make a distinction between the _two primary
components_ that make up the Rocketbook suite:

* **The Rocketbook 'books'** - the physical paper books / notes / cards themselves
* **The Rocketbook app** - the associated software used to capture the Rocketbook pages

### The books
If you have purchased a physical Rocketbook, there is **nothing** stopping you from using it to take notes and
erase them in perpetuity, for as long as the physical Rocketbook pages will last.

If Rocketbook ever stops producing the products, then your ability to do this in the future may be limited to
the books you already have.

### The app
The Rocketbook app, while in no way the only means of capturing images of Rocketbook page notes, is the primary
Rocketbook-supported method to capture notes and store them. 

Crucially - the digital notes captured by the Rocketbook app are stored on "Rocketbook servers" i.e. a set of
storage services that are managed by Rocketbook, and not conventionally accessible to the user themselves.

While this greatly simplifies the note-storage process and eliminates the need for a user to configure, manage, and
maintain their own storage solution, it also means that the digital life of those notes is effectively tied to the
digital life of the Rocketbook service itself - in the event of Rocketbook ceasing to function as a company, 
these notes have the potential to be completely lost if not digitally migrated to a new service.
