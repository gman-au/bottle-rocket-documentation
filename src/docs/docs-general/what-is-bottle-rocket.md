# Bottle Rocket

## What is Bottle Rocket?

The possible / impending discontinuation of the Rocketbook product suite - in particular the app - 
has spurred a desire for alternative solutions that are a near-equivalent replacement.

**Bottle Rocket** is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), 
self-hosted alternative to the Rocketbook **app** and its associated note-storage management.

Principally a [self-hosted solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(network)), Bottle Rocket is 
comprised of **two main components**:
* A **self-hosted server** application that you deploy on a server of your own configuration
* A **mobile app** acting as a client to that server, through which captured Rocketbook notes are sent **exclusively**.

Being open-source and community-driven, Bottle Rocket has the potential to not only satisfy the needs of Rocketbook
users, but also add and extend value to the Rocketbook products themselves.

In any event, the Bottle Rocket system, at a minimum, aims to exist as an isolated solution for your personal 
note-taking with Rocketbook products.
