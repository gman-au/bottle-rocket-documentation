# Rocketbook page symbols

From the [Rocketbook site](https://getrocketbook.com.au/pages/learn-more):

> The seven symbols at the bottom of each page are the magic “buttons” behind the Rocketbook’s quick and easy cloud organization. You assign each icon to the destination of your choice, any folder inside Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs, iCloud, Box, Slack, OneNote, or your email address. When you mark that icon on your page, the Rocketbook app automatically files your notes in the right place.
