# Connectors

## What are connectors?

Connectors are records saved to the Bottle Rocket server that allow you to integrate with other services.
These other services can be anything, from a cloud-based storage provider, to an email service, to a locally hosted
OCR container.

A given [workflow step](/docs/docs-general/configure-your-server/workflows/managing-your-workflows#adding--updating-workflow-steps)
may require a connector to be configured in order to establish an authenticated trust between the Bottle 
Rocket server and the external service.

As Bottle Rocket is a self-hosted platform, you have complete control over the connectors you configure and the
workflows that use them. Each connector comes with configuration instructions that allow you to complete the 
integration to your server.
